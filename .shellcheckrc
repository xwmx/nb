# Disable SC2088
#
# "${HOME}" is preferred in this project, so tildes in quotes are intended as
# tildes and are not expected to expand.

# Disable SC2120
#
# This is being triggered on `_ls`, which is passed arguments in `_main()`.
# This is likely being triggered because `_ls` is called separately explicitly
# without arguments.
